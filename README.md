Hello! I'm Fernando Destefani, a **permanent resident of Canada** with a unique combination of expertise in **front-end development** and a background as a **medical doctor**. 

My journey has been anything but linear:
I started with a Computer Technician diploma, became a medical doctor, and after years in healthcare, I decided to return to my first passion â€” technology.  

What I enjoy most today is creating applications â€” especially in the medical field â€” where I can blend my background in healthcare with software development to build solutions that truly help people.

## Technologies and Tools
