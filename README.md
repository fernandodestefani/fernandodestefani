Hello! I'm Fernando Destefani, a **permanent resident of Canada** with a 🌟unique🌟 combination of expertise in **front-end development** and a background as a **medical doctor**. 

<h2 >👨‍⚕️ My Journey</h2>

My journey has been anything but linear:
I started with a Computer Technician diploma, became a medical doctor, and after years in healthcare, I decided to return to my first passion — technology.

<h2 >💡 What I Do Today</h2>

Now, in the final year of my Software Engineering degree, I apply this combined expertise to create user-focused software solutions — especially in the fields of healthcare and technology, where I can truly understand user pain points, workflows, and requirements.
